This project will share some code scripts that I have come across, and if there are friends willing to share, they can also contribute.

## Background

During project development, I often encounter the need to write and use common utility methods. To make it convenient for myself and others, I decided to create a script library project. And so, this project began.

## Usage

Ideally, code scripts should not require any additional dependencies apart from the JDK compilation environment. However, in projects, it is often not possible to fully achieve this. Nevertheless, I hope to strive towards meeting this standard as much as possible.

Most of the code comes from the internet, and I would like to express my gratitude to the original developers for their selfless contributions. If any original developer feels that their code is not suitable for sharing, please contact me, and I will promptly remove the relevant code.
We will strive to share scripts that have no additional dependencies other than the JDK. If any script includes additional dependencies, they will be clearly indicated in the code comments. Our aim is to make the scripts as user-friendly as possible, ensuring that they can be copied and used seamlessly.
